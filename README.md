- Bootloaders and YOCTO
- Building Linux from Scratch for Embedded Devices

**Task Review (4 hours):**
- Build and configure a simple Linux system using Yocto or Buildroot.

**Live Assessment (4 hours):**
- Q&A and debugging session on Linux Kernel compilation and bootloader configuration.

### Week 2: Linux Kernel Internals
**Lecturing (16 hours):**
- Detailed study of Linux Kernel subsystems (memory management, file systems)
- Kernel modules development
- Device Tree and Hardware Abstraction
- Kernel debugging techniques

**Task Review (4 hours):**
- Write and insert kernel modules, manipulate hardware using the device tree.

**Live Assessment (4 hours):**
